### Introduction

Robocom is a robot combat competition with the aim of object grasping. The engineering vehicle is a differential-wheel platform equipped with auto-aiming aided by computer vision, pneumatically actuatedgraspers. In this competition, participants are tasked with utilizing a robot arm to grab blue blocks and place them in a designated area within limited time. The competition is scored based on the quantity of blocks placed and the height of the stack created, which means the more blocks collected and the higher the stack, the higher the score. This contest not only tests the participants' robotics skills, but also their strategy and time management abilities.

### Contribution
In the Robocom competition, I was responsible for the motion control of the chassis and the robot arm, as well as the mobility strategy of the robot. I significantly optimized the grabbing speed of the robot arm, substantially reducing the time needed to complete tasks. Our team boasted the fastest grapping arm amongst all participating teams that year. This achievement not only enhanced the overall performance of our robot but also made a significant contribution to our team's success in the competition.
