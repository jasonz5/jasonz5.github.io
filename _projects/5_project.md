### Brief Introduction
(* Supplement later)

Robocom is a robot combat competition with the aim of object grasping. The engineering vehicle is a differential-wheel platform equipped with auto-aiming aided by computer vision, pneumatically actuatedgraspers. 

My contribution: Design a keyboard program for simultaneously multi-operation. Optimize movement speed of the manipulator for grasping task. (fastest in that year)
