My name is Jianxiang (Jason) Zhou. I am a Mphil student major in Data Science and Analytics at the [Hongkong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) HKUST(GZ), mentored by [Dr. Yuxuan Liang](https://citymind.top/). I received my B.E. in Robotics Engineering at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech), mentored by [Dr. Zhenzhong Jia](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/jiazhenzhong.html).
<!-- , where I was supervised by Prof. Zhenzhong Jia. -->

Currently I’m interested in spatiol-temporal data mining and urban computing, looking forward to a future of an efficent and satisfactory samrt city for human society. I am a self-motivated and diligent student. Coming from a humble family, I passed through my undergradute study without any financial support from my parents, and took part-time jobs to meet finacial challenges.
