  abstract={This article presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of SWheg, a novel modular wheel-leg transformable robot family with minimalist actuator realization. SWheg takes advantage of both wheeled and legged locomotion by seamlessly integrating them on a single platform. In contrast to other designs that use multiple actuators, SWheg uses only one actuator to drive the transformation of all the wheel-leg modules in sync. This means an N-legged SWheg robot requires only N+1 actuators, which can significantly reduce the cost and malfunction rate of the platform. The tendon-driven wheel-leg transformation mechanism based on a four-bar linkage can perform fast morphology transitions between wheels and legs. We validated the design principle with two SWheg robots with four and six wheel-leg modules separately, namely Quadrupedal SWheg and Hexapod SWheg. The design process, mechatronics infrastructure, and the gait behavioral development of both platforms were discussed. The performance of the robot was evaluated in various scenarios, including driving and turning in wheeled mode, step crossing, irregular terrain passing, and stair climbing in legged mode. The comparison between these two platforms was also discussed.},

  abstract={This paper reports the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of SWhegPro, a swift and robust wheel-leg transformable robot that can operate under heavy payload. SWhegPro can shift wheel morphology between the wheel, e-shape leg, and S-shape leg, the corresponding gaits were developed and compared in simulation. The wheel/leg operation is driven by the same motor, so the actuation system and power can be utilized efficiently. Different from its predecessor which uses tendon-driven transformation mechanisms, SWhegPro utilizes self-locking electric push rods as transformation actuators. This makes it possible for SWhegPro to operate under heavy loads and is easier to repair. The robot was empirically built, and the design process, mechatronics infrastructure, and gait behavioral development were discussed. The performance of the robot was evaluated in various sce-narios, including driving and turning in wheeled mode, step crossing, and irregular terrain passing in legged mode.},

  abstract={Wheel-leg transformable robots have great overall performance in various terrains by taking full advantage of both locomotion modalities. However, they tend to have much more complicated designs and actuators than single-mode robots. This paper proposes a wheel-leg transformable robot design with minimal actuator realization. To this end, we design a novel wheel-leg transformable module that uses tendon-driven mechanism for motion mode switching of each module, and a tendon network that uses a single actuator to control all tendons for mode switching of the entire robot. Hence, a N-legged robot only needs N + 1 actuators. To validate our design, we build an experiment platform, develop associated control algorithms, and conduct both simulation and field experiments over flat ground and rough terrains such as stairs and obstacles.},
